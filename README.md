# Bond.Credit Risk Monitor Engine

Building the credit layer for the agentic economy.

This repo contains our MVP implementation of AgentBeat with credibility verification, risk monitoring, and dynamic credit lines for autonomous agents.

## Overview

- **AgentBeat**: Agent scoring and reputation tracking system
- **Risk Monitor**: Real-time risk assessment and monitoring
- **Credit Vaults**: Dynamic LTV credit lines for agents
- **Credibility Verification**: Multi-factor agent verification and scoring

## Features

### Agent Scoring System
- **Provenance Scoring**: Code verification, audit history, deployment provenance
- **Performance Scoring**: Historical performance data and consistency
- **Perception Scoring**: Community trust and reputation metrics
- **Confidence Calculation**: Data quality and scoring consistency

### Credibility Tiers
- 🥉 **Bronze** (40% max LTV): Basic tier for new agents
- 🥈 **Silver** (50% max LTV): Established agents with proven track record
- 🥇 **Gold** (60% max LTV): High-performing agents with strong reputation
- 🏆 **Platinum** (70% max LTV): Elite agents with exceptional scores
- 💎 **Diamond** (80% max LTV): Top-tier agents with maximum trust

### Credit Vault Management
- Dynamic LTV calculation based on agent scores
- Real-time risk monitoring and health factors
- Automated liquidation protection
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Scoring Engine**: TypeScript with custom algorithms
- **Database**: Ready for integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- **Blockchain**: Multi-chain ready (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/risk-monitor-engine.git
   cd risk-monitor-engine
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## API Endpoints

### Agents API
- `GET /api/agents` - Fetch all agents with optional filters
- `POST /api/agents` - Register a new agent

### Credit API  
- `GET /api/credit` - Fetch credit vaults with optional filters
- `POST /api/credit` - Create a new credit vault

## Scoring Algorithm

The scoring system uses a weighted approach:

```typescript
Overall Score = (Provenance × 40%) + (Performance × 40%) + (Perception × 20%)
```

### Factors:
- **Provenance** (40%): Code verification, audit trail, deployment history
- **Performance** (40%): Task completion rate, accuracy, consistency
- **Perception** (20%): Community feedback, reputation scores

### LTV Calculation:
- Base LTV determined by credibility tier
- Adjustments for high scores, confidence levels, and performance
- Maximum LTV capped at 95% for safety

## Risk Management

### Health Factor Monitoring
```typescript
Health Factor = Collateral Value / Debt Value
```

### Risk Levels:
- **Low Risk**: Health Factor > 2.0
- **Medium Risk**: Health Factor 1.5-2.0  
- **High Risk**: Health Factor 1.2-1.5
- **Critical Risk**: Health Factor < 1.2

## NEAR Protocol Rewards

This project includes specialized tools to help users earn NEAR Protocol Rewards by meeting the three key requirements:

### Requirements for NEAR Protocol Rewards:
1. **Transaction Volume** ($10,000+)
2. **Smart Contract Calls** (500+ calls)
3. **Unique Wallets** (100+ distinct wallets)

### Implementation Approach:

Our solution uses specialized executors to meet each requirement. See the documentation in `PROTOCOL_REWARDS_README.md` for detailed instructions.

### Additional Tools:

This project also includes tools for:

1. **New Wallet Creation and Transfer** - Create new wallets and make transfers (see `NEW-WALLET-TRANSFER.md`)
2. **Wrap/Unwrap Operations** - Convert between NEAR and wNEAR tokens (see `WRAP-UNWRAP-DEMO.md`)
3. **Local Wallet Wrap and Transfer** - Wrap tokens from your local wallet and send to bctemp.near (see `LOCAL-WALLET-WRAP-TRANSFER.md`)
